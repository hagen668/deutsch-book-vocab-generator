# deutsch-book-vocab-generator
Want to learn German vocabulary specific to a certain book or article? This project takes a German word corpus (e.g., Faust) of one's choosing, and uses it to generate a corresponding German-English vocabulary list. The vocabulary list can then be easily imported as a flashcard deck to study apps such as Anki.
